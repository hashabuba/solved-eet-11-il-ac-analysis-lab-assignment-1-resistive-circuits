Objective: To demonstrate that the circuit analysis techniques used for DC resistive circuits also work for AC resistive circuits.

<ol>

 <li>Select a 1 kΩ resistor and a 470 Ω resistor, to be designated RI and R2 respectively. Use the DMM to measure the actual resistance of these two resistors, and record their values below.</li>
